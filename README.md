Truly grateful for all the opportunities that has been presented to me this year. A year ago today I would have never imagine to be in the position I’m in today. I didn’t have the confidence to believe I could get into the tech field. Now that I’m attending the Apple Developer Academy, I’m meeting amazing people and learning a lot of concepts. I now know that I have what it takes to be a great developer and I will manifest this goal! I will be posting occasional updates on a coding topic I learned and how I applied it to my personal project 😁. It’s a wonderful feeling when I’m learning something new and being able to understand and teach the concept to someone else. I’m excited to see my growth in the upcoming months and years to come!
